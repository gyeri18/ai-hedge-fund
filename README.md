# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Aswath Damodaran Agent - The Dean of Valuation, focuses on story, numbers, and disciplined valuation
2. Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
3. Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investor, takes bold positions and pushes for change
4. Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
5. Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett's partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
6. Michael Burry Agent - The Big Short contrarian who hunts for deep value
7. Mohnish Pabrai Agent - The Dhandho investor, who looks for doubles at low risk
8. Nassim Taleb Agent - The Black Swan risk analyst, focuses on tail risk, antifragility, and asymmetric payoffs
9. Peter Lynch Agent - Practical investor who seeks "ten-baggers" in everyday businesses
10. Phil Fisher Agent - Meticulous growth investor who uses deep "scuttlebutt" research 
11. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Agent - The Big Bull of India
12. Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential
13. Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
14. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
15. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
16. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
17. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
18. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
19. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

Note: the system does not actually make any trades.

> **Personal note:** I forked this repo to study how multi-agent LLM systems can be applied to financial analysis. My main interest is in the value investing agents (Graham, Munger, Buffett) and how they weigh qualitative vs. quantitative signals. I'm particularly curious about how the agents handle contradictory signals — e.g., when fundamentals look strong but sentiment is bearish.

## Getting Started

See the original repo's setup instructions. For my own reference, the agents I'm most actively experimenting with are:
- **Ben Graham** and **Warren Buffett** — to compare how margin-of-safety thresholds affect signal output
- **Nassim Taleb** — to see how tail-risk weighting interacts with the Portfolio Manager's position sizing
- **Charlie Munger** — curious whether the qualitative "moat" checks meaningfully differentiate its signals from Buffett's

## My Experiment Log

| Date | Ticker | Agents Used | Observation |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025-04-01 | AAPL | Graham, Buffett, Munger | Graham flagged overvalued; Buffett/Munger both bullish — margin-of-safety threshold difference was the key driver |
| 2025-04-03 | META | Taleb, Fundamentals, Sentiment | Taleb's tail-risk penalty overrode strong fundamentals signal; interesting tension |
